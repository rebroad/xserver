# The Wayland and Xorg Saga: A Fork In The Road

## Introduction: A Brewing Conflict in Display Protocols

The Linux desktop environment has long relied on two primary players to handle its graphical display systems: Xorg and Wayland. While Xorg served as the backbone of graphical environments for decades, Wayland emerged as a modern alternative, promising enhanced performance, security, and simplicity. However, what was once billed as progress has turned into a deeply polarizing subject within the Linux community. Recent developments, including the rumored quiet "abandonment" of Xorg and the emergence of the XLibre fork, have reignited debates about Wayland's intentions and its wider impact on the Linux ecosystem.

This article explores the unfolding conflict, including the alleged challenges surrounding Wayland’s development philosophy, the decline of Xorg, and the eruption of XLibre as a response. Are Wayland's issues simply growing pains, or is there something more nefarious at play? Let’s delve into the controversy.

## The Perpetual Problems of Wayland

Wayland was initially introduced as a streamlined replacement for Xorg, one that promised to address the latter’s perceived inefficiencies and outdated architecture. However, the project has been fraught with challenges since its inception. Many in the Linux community have voiced concerns about Wayland’s lack of receptiveness to user feedback and its apparent disregard for compatibility with longstanding applications and development practices.

### A Community Disillusioned

From the day Wayland was released, critics have pointed to its unwelcoming nature toward end users. Unlike Xorg, which fostered a community-centered approach and emphasized cross-stack development, Wayland has often been described as rigid and inflexible. This rigidity has alienated developers and users alike, particularly those relying on legacy systems or specific software configurations that Wayland struggles to accommodate.

One of the most glaring issues is Wayland's lack of backward compatibility. By failing to support older applications or workflows that depend on Xorg, Wayland has made it difficult for many users to transition. While proponents argue that this focus on modernity is necessary for progress, skeptics believe it reflects a lack of genuine concern for the broader user base.

### Broken Releases and Eroding Trust

Another major criticism is the state of Wayland’s releases. Public confidence in the project has been repeatedly shaken by broken updates, incomplete features, and an overall lack of polish. For a system touted as the future of Linux display protocols, its inability to deliver a stable, reliable experience has left many wondering whether Wayland is truly ready for prime time.

To compound matters, the Wayland team has been accused of ignoring or dismissing community concerns. This perceived indifference has only fueled frustration among users and developers who feel sidelined by the project’s insular approach.

## The Decline of Xorg: Quiet Abandonment or Strategic Neglect?

For years, Xorg served as the backbone of Linux graphical environments, providing a robust and versatile platform for countless applications. However, in recent years, its development has slowed to a crawl, with many accusing the Xorg team of deliberately undermining Xorg to pave the way for Wayland's takeover.

### A Period of Silence

The last two years have been particularly contentious. Xorg’s development has largely stagnated, with hundreds—now over a thousand—merges left untouched. This lack of activity has led many to believe that Xorg has been quietly abandoned, despite the absence of any official announcement or roadmap outlining its future.

Critics argue that this silence from both parties involved, is itself a form of sabotage, designed to erode confidence in Xorg and force users onto Wayland. By refusing to engage with the community or address outstanding issues, the RedHat team has effectively left Xorg to wither on the vine.

### A Fork in the Road: The Emergence of XLibre

The recent creation of XLibre, a fork of Xorg, has brought these tensions to a head. Spearheaded by developers frustrated with the state of Xorg, XLibre aims to breathe new life into the project and provide a viable alternative to Wayland. The fork has been described as a direct response to RedHat's perceived neglect, and its emergence has forced the issue of Xorg’s future back into the spotlight.

## The Worst Kind of Lie: Omission of Data

At the heart of the controversy lies a fundamental issue of transparency—or the lack thereof. Critics of Wayland argue that the project’s leaders have consistently withheld information, leaving users and developers in the dark about critical decisions. This omission of data is seen as a deliberate strategy to help undermine Xorg and push Wayland as the default choice.

### The Consequences of Silence

When a project fails to communicate openly with its community, it creates an environment of uncertainty and mistrust. This is particularly damaging in the open-source world, where collaboration and transparency are key pillars of success. By refusing to address the status of Xorg or engage with its user base, the RedHat team has alienated a significant portion of the Linux community.

## Security vs. Compatibility: The Heart of the Debate

One of Wayland’s core selling points has always been its focus on security. Unlike Xorg, which relies on a more permissive architecture, Wayland was designed with strict internal security measures to prevent malicious applications from interfering with the system. While this is undeniably a step forward in many respects, it has also created significant compatibility issues.

### The Trade-Offs of Modernity

The incompatibility between Wayland and many older applications has been a major sticking point for users. While some argue that these trade-offs are necessary to ensure a more secure and modern system, others believe that Wayland’s refusal to accommodate legacy software represents a fundamental flaw in its design philosophy.

## The Way Forward: Can XLibre Challenge Wayland?

The emergence of XLibre has injected new life into the debate over Linux display protocols. By offering a revitalized version of Xorg, XLibre has the potential to provide a viable alternative to Wayland, particularly for users and developers who feel alienated by the latter’s approach.

### Challenges Ahead

However, XLibre faces significant challenges. As a fork of Xorg, it inherits many of the same issues that led to the original project’s decline. Additionally, it will need to build a strong community of developers and users to ensure its long-term success.

### A Call for Collaboration

Ultimately, the Linux ecosystem would benefit from greater collaboration between the Xorg, Wayland, and XLibre communities. By working together, these projects could address their respective shortcomings and create a more unified and robust system for Linux users.

## Conclusion: A Divided Future

The ongoing conflict between Xorg and Wayland highlights the challenges of balancing progress with compatibility in the open-source world. While Wayland represents a bold step forward, its insular approach and compatibility issues have alienated many users. Conversely, Xorg’s stagnation has left it vulnerable to obsolescence, forcing the community to consider alternatives like XLibre.

As the dust settles, one thing is clear: the Linux community must find a way to bridge these divides and create a future that works for everyone. Whether that future involves Wayland, XLibre, or a combination of the two remains to be seen.
